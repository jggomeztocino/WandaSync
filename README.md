# WandaSync 🌐

Welcome to **WandaSync**! A next-generation e-commerce system that leverages modern architectures and cutting-edge technologies to deliver a highly efficient, secure, and robust platform.

## 🚀 Project Overview

WandaSync is an e-commerce project designed to meet the demands of a real-world enterprise. Built with scalability and performance in mind, it employs industry best practices and advanced design patterns to create a system that stands up to real-world challenges.

## 🎯 Objectives

- **High Efficiency**: Fast processing and handling of large data volumes.
- **Security**: Protecting user data and ensuring secure transactions.
- **Robustness**: Fault-tolerant system capable of quick recovery.
- **Scalability**: Architecture ready to grow and adapt to increasing demands.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Backend**:
  - [Java](https://www.java.com/) & [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
  - [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) for messaging and event processing
- **Databases**:
  - [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for relational data
  - [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for NoSQL data
- **Infrastructure**:
  - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for containerization
  - [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) for container orchestration
  - [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) for monitoring and alerting
  - [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) for data visualization and analytics
- **Architecture**:
  - **Hexagonal Architecture**: For a modular and maintainable application
  - **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)**: Implementing **Event-Carried State Transfer (ECST)**
  - **Microservices**: Independent and individually deployable services

## 📐 System Architecture

The system is designed following hexagonal architecture principles and is event-driven, enabling high cohesion and low coupling between components. This facilitates scalability and long-term maintenance.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Real-Time Processing**: Leveraging Kafka to handle events in real-time, enhancing user experience.
- **High Availability**: Implementation of redundant microservices and load balancing.
- **Advanced Monitoring and Logging**: Utilizing **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for effective monitoring, tracking, and troubleshooting.
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Docker and Kubernetes ensure smooth deployment and scaling of services.

## 🎓 About the Project

This project is my Final Degree Project (TFG) and also serves as a showcase to demonstrate my skills as a software developer. I have applied best practices and design patterns to create a system that meets industry standards.
